# Setting up a Build Agent
# https://learn.acloud.guru/course/e81aa3d0-bd3e-4a49-9bf8-dc4412e74f6c/learn/6f4a166b-2275-4b3e-b10b-789a87f93f52/847d4e30-a80a-4c04-b643-15049b911e45/watch

# In this lesson, we will be setting up a remote build agent using an Ubuntu server on our cloud playground. This is the first step in distributing a build, and once we have the build agent setup completed, we will move forward with creating distributed builds. 

# In the process of setting up the build agent the following commands are used:

# From your agent worker1 node, set up the jenkins user:

ls -l /var/lib
sudo mkdir /var/lib/jenkins

ls -l /var/lib | grep jenkins
sudo useradd -d /var/lib/jenkins jenkins
sudo chown jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins

# Generating and setting ssh keys

ssh-keygen

sudo mkdir /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# copy the key content and paste it

sudo vim /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Installing java

sudo apt-get update

# Make sure the java version on agent worker1 matches the java version installed in your Jenkins server

sudo apt install -y openjdk-17-jre

# Getting the private key for the user

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Correcting the known hosts issue once we have ssh'd from master to agent

sudo cp ./.ssh/known_hosts /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh

# Go to Jenkins console:

Manage Jenkins > Nodes and Clouds > + New Node

Node name: "worker1"
Select "Permanent Agent"
Description: "ubuntu server"
Number of executors: 2
Remote root directory: /var/lib/jenkins
Labels: linux_deb
Usage: "Use this node as much as possible"
Launch method: "Launch agents via SSH"
Host: public IP address of the node
Credentials: Add > Jenkins
Kind: "SSH Username with private key"
Description: "remote ubuntu creds"
Username: jenkins
Private Key > Enter directly > Add > paste the key copied previously > Add
Credentials: select "jenkins (remote ubuntu creds)"
Host Key Verification Strategy: "Known hosts file Verification Strategy"
Save

Click "worker1"
Click "See log for more details"

# From your Jenkins server, SSH to your agent worker1 public IP

ssh cloud_user@<Agent worker1 public IP>

# Once connected to your agent worker 1, exit back to your Jenkins server

exit

# Copy known_hosts to /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh

sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
sudo chown jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
sudo cp ~/.ssh/known_hosts /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/

# Check your agent worker1 status
